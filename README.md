The increasing popularity of online shopping has led to the emergence of new economic activities. 
To succeed in the highly competitive e-commerce environment, it is vital to understand consumer intention. 
Understanding what motivates consumer intention is critical because such intention is key to survival in this fast-paced and hypercompetitive environment. Where prior research has attempted at most a limited adaptation of the information system success model, 
we propose a comprehensive, empirical model that separates the ‘use’ construct into ‘intention to use’ and ‘actual use’. 
This makes it possible to test the importance of user intentions in determining their online shopping behaviour.
